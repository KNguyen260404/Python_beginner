> **Modern lightweight cryptography for the connected world** 🌐

ASCON is a family of authenticated encryption and hashing algorithms, winner of the NIST Lightweight Cryptography competition. This implementation brings enterprise-grade security to your Python applications with minimal overhead.

## ✨ Features

- 🚀 **Lightning Fast**: Optimized for performance on both high-end servers and IoT devices
- 🛡️ **Battle-Tested Security**: NIST-approved lightweight cryptography standard
- 🔧 **Easy Integration**: Simple API that works out of the box
- 📱 **IoT Ready**: Perfect for resource-constrained environments
- 🌍 **Cross-Platform**: Works seamlessly across all major platforms

## 🚦 Quick Start

```python
from ascon import encrypt, decrypt, hash_data

# Encrypt sensitive data
key = b"your-32-byte-secret-key-here!!!!"
data = b"Hello, secure world!"
encrypted = encrypt(key, data)

# Decrypt when needed
decrypted = decrypt(key, encrypted)

# Hash for integrity
digest = hash_data(data)
```

## 🏗️ Installation

```bash
pip install ascon-crypto
```

Or clone and install from source:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ascon-python.git
cd ascon-python
pip install -e .
```

## 📖 Documentation

### Core Functions

| Function | Purpose | Example |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `encrypt(key, plaintext)` | Authenticated encryption | `encrypt(key, b"secret")` |
| `decrypt(key, ciphertext)` | Authenticated decryption | `decrypt(key, encrypted_data)` |
| `hash_data(data)` | Cryptographic hashing | `hash_data(b"message")` |

### Advanced Usage

```python
# Custom nonce (for advanced users)
from ascon import encrypt_with_nonce, generate_nonce

nonce = generate_nonce()
encrypted = encrypt_with_nonce(key, data, nonce)

# Batch processing
from ascon import batch_encrypt

files = [b"file1", b"file2", b"file3"]
encrypted_files = batch_encrypt(key, files)
```

## 🧪 Testing

Run the test suite:
```bash
python -m pytest tests/ -v
```

Performance benchmarks:
```bash
python benchmarks/speed_test.py
```

## 🎯 Use Cases

- 🔒 **Secure Messaging**: End-to-end encryption for chat applications
